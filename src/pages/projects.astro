    title: "Project 1: Iterative Methods Efficiency",
    summary: "This project focuses on the efficiency of iterative methods.It includes a detailed analysis of convergence rates and computational complexity. It also provides a comparison of different iterative methods, such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel. It also dives into the Parallel Programming aspects of these methods and how they can be optimized for modern hardware. It also includes a detailed analysis of the convergence rates and computational complexity of these metative methods for solving linear systems. hods.",
